Build 0039
- Fixed an issue that would cause the spectro effect to be clipped off at the bottom with some settings.

Build 0038
- Further changed the look and feel of controls on the Spectro page.
- Changes to the base styles have led to small changes on all pages.
- The Fn key on the STRAFE and STRAFE-RGB should now light up correctly when in SDK mode.
- The Corsair Logo on the STRAFE and STRAFE-RGB should now light up correctly when in SDK mode.
- Switched the default Log level back to 6, since it's pretty useless at 0 if there's a problem on first launch.
- Fixed a crash.
- Found an issue where weird stuff happens when minimum sensitivity is set really low. Will attempt to fix in the next build.

Build 0037
- Fixed a bug that would cause crashes when running the program for the first time.
- Adjusted the size and positioning of the SpinButtons in UpDown controls so the arrows are centered and borders line up with ComboBoxes.
- Changed default frames per second to 30.
- Implemented per-row lighting options for the Spectro.
- Included the Rainbow cycle time options on the appropriate Spectro settings.

Build 0036
- Built a custom CUE.NET and set the project back to targetting .NET 4.5.2.
- Prevented Spectro from starting itself when devices automatically change.
- Fixed an issue where Spectro tried to overlay itself into other effects.
- Added Spectrum Fade to the Spectro styles list.
- Added Defined Rows to the Spectro styles list but it's still totally broken so it's disabled right now.
- Renamed the 'Colour' label in Spectro to 'Styles'.
- Changed spectro smoothing from high quality to high speed.
- When all layers are disabled, a black frame is sent to devices, then nothing else is sent to them.
- Built a new frame timing routine. Frames can now be selected by Frames per Second. If you choose a higher FPS than your machine can handle, it will simply run as fast as it can.
- Spectro only calculates on request from a frame. This improves performance somewhat, but more improvements are coming.
- Changed Frame Delay label to Frames per Second, and adjusted positioning so it lines up with the UpDown.
- Allowed effects to be sent only to mice, when no keyboards are selected.
- - Deselecting a keyboard can cause some weird behaviour. Until this is fixed, hit Restart Engine to correct everything.
- Starting effects without having selected a device should no longer crash the program.

Build 0035
- Removed the "Image" background effect. This may eventually be re-implemented in a better way later on.
- Added up and down directions for background rainbow.
- Added "Default Device" options for input and output.
- When Default Device is selected, CEE will check the default device in Windows every two seconds and update itself if needed.
- Changing audio devices will now apply the changes automatically.
- When "Use SDK" is enabled, the "16.8 Million Colors" option is disabled, as the settings in CUE are used.
- Changed the default log level to 0.
- Swapped positions of the rainbow direction and brightness controls.
- "Apply" button in Spectro Settings page has been renamed to "Restart".
- Adjusted the position of the Frequency settings in Spectro.
- Modified the Disabled look of ComboBoxes.
- Moved the Donation button to be in a less awkward spot.
- Adjusted the location of the "Frame Delay" label to line up properly with the content of the value next to it.

Build 0034
- New high-end gain algorithms. These should look a lot better than what was in build 0033.
- Changed the spectro Gradient to Gradient Horizontal.
- Added Gradient Vertical.
- Mapped M keys, brightness, and WinLock keys through the SDK.

Build 0033
- SDK support. Currently only supports the keyboard, the rest are coming soon.
- Added Rainbow effects to the Spectro. Rainbows can travel all four directions.
- Added Gradient effects to the Spectro. Two-colour gradients can be selected.
- Added tooltips to all Spectro options to help users understand them a bit better.
- Added Spectro high frequency gain.

Build 0032
- Initial SDK support.

Build 0031
- New self-updater tests.

Build 0030
- Corrected a crash in the self-updater.

Build 0029
- Added support for the Strafe RGB.
- When no effects are enabled, nothing is sent to the devices. This allows CUE to work while CEE is stopped.
- Redesigned the inner workings of the FFT process. The following options can now be chosen:
- - FFT Size (changing this requires you to hit "Apply")
- - Bins per point
- - Windowing type
- - Minimum and maximum dB response levels
- - Minimum and maximum frequencies to display
- - Color (Special effects such as rainbow are coming, but blending with the background does work)
- - Logarithmic or linear representation of frequencies or volumes

Build 0028
- Fixed aspect ratio of loaded images.
- Fixed an issue that would cause the program to crash if an image was used without a keyboard selected.
- By popular demand, added a link to my donation page in the program.

Build 0027
- Incremented the build number properly. -_-

Build 0026
- Fixed an issue with loading an image.
- Fixed an issue where the Self Updater would blow up when it tried to overwrite files.

Build 0025
- Implemented the following settings:
- - Start with Windows.
- - Start minimized.
- - Launch CUE on exit.
- Removed the Minimize instead of close option, as it is not needed and over-complicates things.
- Fixed case for control box tooltips.
- Implemented the Image background mode. Support for animated GIFs is coming soon.

Build 0024
- Built UI elements to support Spectro.
- Built new Breathe background effect.
- Reordered the background effects list to flow better.
- Added an invisible background to the checkmark/cross that appears for CheckBoxes. This makes them less finicky.
- Moved the left buttons down to better line up with the bottom of the window.
- Modified the formula behind fade style lighting.
- Made the program always start in the center of the screen.

Build 0023
- Reworked SampleAggregator and pretty much everything. Again. Then gave up. Again.
- Implemented a temporary spectro similar to the original.

Build 0022
- Changed from CSCore to NAudio.

Build 0021
- Included the old spectro routines.
- Inclusion of a self-updater.
- Fixed a bug that caused Random Lights on the mouse to spazz out.

Build 0020
- Changed the way the program looks for files, allowing it to be launched from folders other than its own.
- Converted key mappings to a Dictionary structure; producing a huge increase in speed.

Build 0019
- Re-worked layer blending to run with Alpha channel values.
- Re-worked colour effects to work with the new blending mode.
- Made the Rainbow run through the Hue spectrum in HSV, instead of through RGB.

Build 0018
- System Tray icon will now be disposed when the MainWindow closes.
- Added a floor in the heatmap so any key that was pressed will never completely revert to the Least colour.

Build 0017
- Corrected issues with the system tray context menu appearance.

Build 0016
- Corrected an issue where the system tray context menu doesn't close.

Build 0015
- Heatmap fully integrated.
- Changed the RgbSliders Accept/Cancel buttons to match the rest of the interface.
- Minimize to Tray has been integrated.
- System tray context menu has been integrated.

Build 0014
- New UI.
- Initial Alpha release.

Builds 0001 through 0013
- Development of new program and engine.

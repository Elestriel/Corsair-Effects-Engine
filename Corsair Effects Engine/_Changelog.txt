Build 0033
- SDK support. Currently only supports the keyboard, the rest are coming soon.
- Added Rainbow effects to the Spectro. Rainbows can travel all four directions.
- Added Gradient effects to the Spectro. Two-colour gradients can be selected.
- Added tooltips to all Spectro options to help users understand them a bit better.
- Added Spectro high frequency gain.

Build 0032
- Initial SDK support.

Build 0031
- New self-updater tests.

Build 0030
- Corrected a crash in the self-updater.

Build 0029
- Added support for the Strafe RGB.
- When no effects are enabled, nothing is sent to the devices. This allows CUE to work while CEE is stopped.
- Redesigned the inner workings of the FFT process. The following options can now be chosen:
- - FFT Size (changing this requires you to hit "Apply")
- - Bins per point
- - Windowing type
- - Minimum and maximum dB response levels
- - Minimum and maximum frequencies to display
- - Color (Special effects such as rainbow are coming, but blending with the background does work)
- - Logarithmic or linear representation of frequencies or volumes

Build 0028
- Fixed aspect ratio of loaded images.
- Fixed an issue that would cause the program to crash if an image was used without a keyboard selected.
- By popular demand, added a link to my donation page in the program.

Build 0027
- Incremented the build number properly. -_-

Build 0026
- Fixed an issue with loading an image.
- Fixed an issue where the Self Updater would blow up when it tried to overwrite files.

Build 0025
- Implemented the following settings:
- - Start with Windows.
- - Start minimized.
- - Launch CUE on exit.
- Removed the Minimize instead of close option, as it is not needed and over-complicates things.

- Implemented the Image background mode. Support for animated GIFs is coming soon.

Build 0024
- Built UI elements to support Spectro.
- Built new Breathe background effect.
- Reordered the background effects list to flow better.

- Modified the formula behind fade style lighting.
- Made the program always start in the center of the screen.

- Converted key mappings to a Dictionary structure; producing a huge increase in speed.

Build 0019

- Re-worked colour effects to work with the new blending mode.
- Made the Rainbow run through the Hue spectrum in HSV, instead of through RGB.
